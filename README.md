# DurJam2020

Our team consists of Priyanka Jhooty, Danica Davies and Eman Abbasi. We are all students at Aston University going into our second year of study. For our submission we decided to use Unity, coding in C#, to create a game which has been named 'GOOSE' for some reason.

Music has been provided by Toby Cotton - (potentially link to socials)
