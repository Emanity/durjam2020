# DurJam2020

Our team consists of Priyanka Jhooty, Danica Davies and Eman Abbasi. We are all students at Aston University going into our second year of study. For our submission we decided to use Unity, coding in C#, to create a game which has been named 'GOOSE' for some reason.

## Story

Set in a world where geese are (EA:rightfully, in my opinion) hated, we follow the story of one brave goose called Paul.

Paul the Goose has been captured by the evil krone Karen and is set to be cooked and eaten by her gang of entitled Boomers. Seeing his demise fast approaching, Paul makes one last daring move to escape. Wriggling out of Karen's grasp, he makes a mad dash outside. While hiding from an enraged Karen, the wind suddenly blows a flyer his way. What's this! A Geese Rescue Center? Now knowing where he must go, Paul makes his way out into the city in hopes of finding sanctuary.

## How to Play

GOOSE is effectively an endless runner type game. While Paul makes his way to the Geese Rescue Center, he will have to duck underneath protestors and jump over children. Colliding with any obstacle in his way will lead to an instant Game Over.

## Special Thanks To

Toby Cotton for letting us use his GCSE Music compositions as background music for our game!
